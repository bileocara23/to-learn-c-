in condition and loop syntaxes we have: if, else, for, while, do...

if example x = 2 and y = 1:
if (x == y){
    //if x equal y, execute function between {}
}
else {
    //if the (if) condition is not satisfied execute this function
}

There is also "else if", which looks like "if", but is add after the first "if". Unlike "else", 
"else if" allows you to add another condition.


FOR



while and do

while is used to verify a condition and execute a function if it is true
example: 
int x = 3;
while (x <= 10){
    //function
    x++
}
//when x value == 10 or >= 10, the script continue
//

now, do...while is different, "do" execute function and "while" verify if condition is satisfied,
is not, do again.
example:
do{
    //function
    x++
}
while (x <= 10)
